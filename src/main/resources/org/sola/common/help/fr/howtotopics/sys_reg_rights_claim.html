        <h1>Systematic Registration Rights Claim</h1>

        <p> 
        </p>


        <h2>Initially Record a New Rights Claim</h2>
        <br>To record a new systematic registration Rights Claim (or Counter Claim), use the SOLA Desktop software
        and access the Application Details screen from the Applications > New Applications menu or by selecting  
        <img style="width: 20px; height: 20px;" alt="" src="../images/addSource.png">

        <br>The initial details that need to be recorded are:
        <ul>
            <li>On the General tab for the new application form, in the Contact Details panel enter the 
                claimant (or the person who is the contact person for the claimant or claimants) details 
                including their first name, last name and address and contact details
            </li>
            <li>On the Services tab, add a new service by double clicking on “Systematic Registration”</li>
            <li>On the Property tab, enter the Parcel Number (in the First Part field), Block and 
                Village/District name (in the Last Part field) and the land use
            </li>
            <li>On the Documents tab, all documents such as the completed and signed claim form should be
                recorded (but there is no need to link the scanned image of the documents unless it is
                convenient to do so)
            </li>
            <li>On the Fees tab, click on the Calculate Fees toolbar icon and record invoice number, amount
                paid and click on the Fees Paid radio button
            </li>
            <li>Once the necessary information has been entered, save the application. This will lodge the
                application, assign an application number and display the Lodgement Notice for your review.
                You can choose to print (or save the Lodgement Notice and record and link it from the
                Documents tab)
            </li>
        </ul>    


        <br>
        <h2>Complete Claim Details</h2>
        <br>To complete the entry of the claim details you will need to edit the application that initially recorded the claim. 
        Select the application in the assigned or unassigned application lists on the Dashboard and choose Edit. If the application 
        is not displayed in the application lists, use the Search Application screen to locate it and click the Edit button. 
        This will open the Application Details screen allowing you to edit the application details and save changes.
        <ol>
            <li>Open the application and check the Fee paid flag on the Fees tab</li>
            <li>Assign the application with the Systematic Registration service to yourself</li>
            <li>Open the assigned application and in the Documents tab identify the documents without a link to a scanned image. 
                At the same time and additional supporting documents not captured at the time the claim was originally recorded should 
                be entered and linked to the scanned images of these supporting documents
            </li>
            <li>Click on the Document Search toolbar icon and search for the documents without linked imaged identified at the previous step. 
                Select the document record, click on the <img style="width: 50px; height: 20px;" alt="" src="../images/07_edit_icon.png">  icon 
                and add the link for the scanned document</li>
            <li>Start the Systematic Registration Claim service</li>
            <li>SOLA will open the Property Details screen with the property reference for the new property already set. Verify this matches the claim form.
                If the property reference is not correct, close the Property Details screen without saving and remove the property details on the Property tab
                of the Application Details screen, save the application and click on <img style="width: 20px; height: 20px;" alt="" src="../images/start_again_icon.png">
