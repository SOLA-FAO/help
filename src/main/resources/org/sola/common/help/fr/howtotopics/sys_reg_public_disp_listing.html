        <h1>Prepare Public Display Listings</h1>

        <p>In this step various listings are prepared for use in the public notification period. The listings include two listings 
            of private land holdings; one ordered by claimant name and the second by parcel number. A listing of State land holdings 
            can also be produced.
            <br>
            All listings are for a Block within a designated systematic registration area.
        </p>


        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>From the Dashboard form click on the Systematic Registration – Public Display menu option.
                From a further sub menu option select the type of listing you want to generate.
            </li>
            <li>Enter date that Public Display begins for the Block.
            </li>
            <li>Enter the name of the Block in the Location field. As you type the block name, the names of 
                the blocks subject to systematic registration will appear in a list below in a “google search” like fashion.
                When the name of the Block that you need to create a public notification listing appears in that list then 
                select that row and click on the View button.
            </li>
            <li>The report is stored in the SOLA digital archive and can be retrieved by a regular Document search
                and has a document reference of “PublicDisplay<<Block Name>> and a document type of public notification
                </li>
        </ol>
