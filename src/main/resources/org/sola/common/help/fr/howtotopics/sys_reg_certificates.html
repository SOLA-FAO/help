        <h1>Prepare Registration Certificates</h1>

        <p>This functionality allows you to print registration certificates for all parcels 
            within a block of a systematic registration area where the claim for systematic registration
            has been upheld and the claim application approved
        </p>


        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                From the Dashboard form on the main menu bar click on the Systematic Registration – Certificate menu option.
            </li>
            <li>Enter the name of the Block in the Location field. As you type the block name, the names 
                of the blocks subject to systematic registration will appear in a list below in a “google search” like fashion. 
                When the name of the Block that you need to create a public notification listing appears in that list then 
                select that row and click on the View button.
            </li>
            <li>The certificates are stored in the SOLA digital archive and can be retrieved by a regular Document search
                using the new title reference (being <<Parcel Number>>_<<Block and District Name>> as the reference number 
                    and title as document type
                    </li>
                    </ol>
