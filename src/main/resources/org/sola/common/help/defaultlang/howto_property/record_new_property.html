       Record New Property
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Record New Property task allows you to create new state land property records in SOLA
      State Land. When creating a new state land property you should also create new state land
      parcels using the Create or Change Parcels task.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Lodge a new job. Make sure it includes the Record New Property task. You should also
            add a Create or Change Parcels task to create any parcels for the new state land
            property.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have added a Create or Change Parcels task to the job, process that task first.
          </li>
          <li>
            From the Tasks tab of the Job Details screen, select the Record New Property task and
            click the <img src="../images/icons/start.png" hspace="4">Start tool. This will open
            the Property Details screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the General tab, enter a description for the property and link any relevant
            documents. You can leave the Area empty has this is populated when you add parcels.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Parcels tab, click <img src="../images/icons/add.png" hspace="4">Add and use the
            Add State Land Parcel dialog to select or create the parcels for the property.&nbsp; 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                If you have created new parcels using the Create or Change Parcels task, these will
                be displayed on the Job tab. Highlight the parcel you want to add to the property
                and click <img src="../images/icons/confirm.png" hspace="4"> Select.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the parcel has no spatial definition, and it is not already recorded in SOLA
                State Land, you can use the New Parcel tab to enter details describing the new
                parcel. When all details are entered, click&nbsp;<img src=
                "../images/icons/confirm-close.png" hspace="4"> Close.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the parcel you want to link to the property is already recorded in SOLA State
                Land, use the Search Parcel tab and enter the parcel appellation (i.e. lot and plan
                number). A list of matching parcels will be displayed for you to choose. Use <img
                src="../images/icons/confirm.png" hspace="4"> Select to add the chosen parcel to
                the property.

            On the Interests tab, you will see a State Landholder interest has been automatically

                If the property is being leased or licensed by the state from another party, (i.e.

            If there are other interests on the property (e.g. easements, restrictions, leases,
