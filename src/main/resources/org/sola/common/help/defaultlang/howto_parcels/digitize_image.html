       Add a Plan Image for Digitizing
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       When performing a Create or Change Parcels task, you can choose to add an image of a plan to
      the Map Viewer to assist with digitizing the state land parcels directly from the plan.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To add a plan image to the map you must first have an image file available on your local
      hard drive. The file formats supported by the Map Viewer are TIFF, PNG and JPEG.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Add Image tool <img src="../images/icons/image-add.png" hspace="4">&nbsp;works by
      matching two points you select on the map with two points you select from the image. Before
      adding the image, you should compare the plan to the Map Viewer and identify two candidate
      parcel nodes that exist on both the plan and the Map Viewer.&nbsp; For the best match
      accuracy, the first node you select should be at the bottom left of the plan image and the
      second point at the top right (or top left and bottom right). Note that the current Add image
      tool does not rotate the image. If the plan does not have the standard North orientation,
      then you will need to use an image editing tool to rotate the plan image so that North on the
      plan corresponds with North in the Map Viewer (i.e. toward the top of your computer screen).
      If you are unable to rotate the plan image, do not attempt to digitize from the plan as the
      result will be inaccurate.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Once you have the image file ready and identified the two matching points, click the Add
      image tool <img src="../images/icons/image-add.png" hspace="4">. You will be prompted to
      select the first of two points on the Map Viewer. Zoom in if necessary to ensure your
      selection is accurate. You will then be prompted to select a second point. Again, zoom in or
      pan if necessary to ensure your selection is accurate.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Add Image tool will then prompt you to select your image file from your local hard
      drive. Upon making your selection, the image file will be displayed in the Add Image Preview
      dialog. You can enlarge this dialog as necessary to improve your selection accuracy. Click
      the image at the location matching the first point you selected from the map. A green cross
      will appear on the image. Click the image at the location matching the second point from the
      map and a second green cross will appear.

       <b>Add Image Preview Dialog with 2 Selections</b>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To proceed, click the OK button on the Add Image Preview dialog. The image will be scaled as
      required and displayed in the Map Viewer.&nbsp; The image will display on top of the standard
      Map Viewer navigation layers, but will appear below the editing layers added for Record Plan.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       If you make a mistake, you can remove the image from the Map Viewer using the Remove Image
      tool <img src="../images/icons/image-remove.png" hspace="4">and re-add the image. You can
      also change your selections in the Add Image Preview dialog by re-selecting the location of
      the first point after you have added the second point. Be aware that re-selecting the first
      point will require you to re-select your second point as well.
