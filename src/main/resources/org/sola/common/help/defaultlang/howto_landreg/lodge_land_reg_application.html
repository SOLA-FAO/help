       Lodge and Process a Land Registration Application
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The following provides detailed steps on how to lodge and process a land registration
      application. For information on how to process Land Registration services, refer to the
      appropriate Land Registration How To section.

       Lodge an Application
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The first step when making changes to the land registry is to create an application with the
      appropriate service or services. Where those services are likely to require payment, lodging
      the application should be done while the agent or applicant is in attendance so that you can
      provide them with the lodgement notice detailing the fees payable.&nbsp;

       <b>Steps</b>
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            From the Dashboard select the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/new.png">New
            application tool to open the Application Details screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the General tab, enter the contact details for the person making the request and
            select the agent from the Agent drop down if appropriate.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Services tab, select one or more land registration services depending on the
            changes you need to make to the land registry. If you select more than one service, you
            should order the services in a logical sequence. E.g. for a discharge, transfer and
            mortgage, the Remove Restriction (General) service should be at the top, followed by
            the Change of Ownership service with the Register Mortgage service at the bottom.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Property tab, enter the title reference for the property that is being changed
            and add them to the application using the Add property button. In the case of a new
            plan, you should add the title references for the properties being subdivided or
            amalgamated (i.e. the properties that will be extinguished) by the plan.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            You should verify each property using the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/document-task.png">Verify tool to confirm Registry contains the
            appropriate details for the property. If the Title Exists checkbox is not checked, this
            may indicate the title reference is invalid or the title has yet to be converted from
            paper format. Use the Property Search screen and/or Map Find to attempt to locate the
            property record.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Documents tab, record each of the physical documents provided by the applicant.
            The documents required are dependent on the service(s) selected. When capturing
            document information&nbsp; 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                Ensure you select the appropriate document type and record the document date (i.e.
                the date recorded on the face of the physical document) or today’ s date if the
                physical document is not dated.
              </li>
              <li>
                Enter a reference number for the document and a description. The reference number
                should be taken from the physical document. If the physical document does not have
                any reference number, then enter the application number, period and document
                sequence number (e.g. 120001.03).
              </li>
              <li>
                The Source Agency is the name of the organization that created the physical
                document. For example, this could be the bank for mortgage documents, or the agents
                firm details for agreements and other document types. This field is optional and
                can be left blank.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you have scanned the document, use the Attachment field to link in the scanned
                image. If you have not yet scanned the document, you will need to do this at a
                later stage and link it into the document using the Edit Document functionality
                available from Document Search.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            You should also attach a Proof of Identity document for the agent/applicant to the
            application. This could be a passport style photo the copy of a birth certificate. This
            can be linked directly to the property changes made for the application and used to
            help confirm the validity of future property transactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Map points are optional for Land Registration applications. You can add one by
            navigating the map to the location of the property and using the <img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/application-location-add.png">Add Application Point tool. If you are
            not sure of the location of the property and cannot locate it using the Map Find, then
            <b>do not</b> add an Application point.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/save.png">Save button. This will lodge
            the application and produce the lodgment notice. Print the notice and give it to the
            agent as proof the application has been lodged. The lodgment notice will indicate the
            fee to be paid for the application.

    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Once the lodgement notice is printed, the applicant will need to take the notice to the
      cashier and arrange payment. When payment has been made, the cashier will<img hspace="4" src=

            for the application has been paid. If the fee has not been paid it will not be possible
            to assign the application. In this situation notify the contact person and/or cashier
            to confirm the payment status for the application.
          </li>
