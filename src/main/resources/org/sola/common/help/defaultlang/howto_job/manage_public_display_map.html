       Create a Public Display Map for a Job
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The state is obligated to ensure all parties that may be affected by its actions in relation
      to state land are adequately notified of the state’s intentions. This is often addressed
      through public notices and advertising. The Public Display Map screen can be used to produce
      a large scale printout illustrating the parcels affected by a job in relation to other
      parcels and geographic features. The printout can be posted on notice boards or in public
      spaces or used as addendum to other public display material.

       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Lodge a new job. Make sure it includes the Public Display Map task. You must also
            include the Create or Change Parcels task as the Public Display Map task will
            automatically zoom and highlight the parcels you add to the job using that task.
          </li>
          <li>
            From the Tasks tab of the Job Details screen, select the Create or Change Parcels task
            and click the <img src="../images/icons/start.png" hspace="4"> Start tool. The Parcel
            Map Editor will display.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the parcels you want to display on the Public Display Map to the job using the map
            tools available in the Parcel Map Editor. When you have added all of the necessary
            parcels, <img src="../images/icons/save.png" hspace="4"> Save your changes and close
            the Parcel Map Editor.
          </li>
          <li>
            From the Tasks tab of the Job Details screen, select the Public Display Map task and
            click the <img src="../images/icons/start.png" hspace="4">Start tool. The Public
            Display Map screen will display, zooming to the location of the parcels added to the
            job and highlighting them on the map.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Layers tab, adjust the map layers (if necessary) to show the information you
            want to appear in the map printout.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Public Display Map tab, choose the page layout, set the print scale and add an
            area description and notification period (if required). You an optionally add a label
            to display in the centre of the map. 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                Be aware the map area you see displayed on screen is not necessarily the same as
                the area shown in the map print out. This is because the map area may be forced to
                resize to match the layout and scale you select for the print out.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            To generate the print out, click the Print map button. The SOLA Report Viewer will
            display showing the print out. Use the viewer to check the print out and if it matches
            your requirements, use the viewer to send the document to a printer or save the
            document in one of the supported formats (PDF, DOCX, ODT or HTML). 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                If the print out does not match your requirements, close the viewer and use the
                Public Display Map to pan the map and/or adjust the scale for the print out and try
                to generate the print out again.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you have obtained the print out(s) you require, close the Public Display Map
            screen to return to the Job Details screen. You should attach a copy of the print outs
            as Public Display Items (using the Manage Public Display task) or as documents to the
            job.
          </li>
          <li>
            Go to the Tasks tab of the Job Details screen, select the Public Display Map task and
            click the <img src="../images/icons/confirm.png" hspace="4">Complete tool. This will
            run the SOLA State Land business rules to validate the job data. If there is a critical
            failure, you must remedy the failure as it will not be possible to approve the job
            otherwise.
          </li>
          <li>
            If all tasks for the job are complete (or cancelled), proceed with approving (and
            archiving) the job.
          </li>
