       Services are a key component of Registry as they control the changes that can be made to the
      land register and cadastre information maintained by Registry. Every application lodged in
      Registry must include at least one service. In cases where several changes to the land
      registry or cadastre information are required as part of a single application, you can choose
      to add multiple services to the application. The categories of services supported by Registry
      are
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            Registration Services
          </li>
          <li>
            Survey Services
          </li>
          <li>
            Supporting Services
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Changes made to the land register information as part of a service must be justified by a
      document of some kind. This could be a completed application form requesting a particular
      change or it could be a legal or official document (e.g. survey plan) describing a change to
      the land register information. These documents must be scanned and linked to the Registry
      application in support of services.&nbsp; If the documents required by a service are not
      linked to the application, Registry will not allow the service to be completed. The documents
      required for each service are noted in the following sections. You can obtain more details
      about a specific document type from the Documents section.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Each service can be assigned a fee that may have up to 3 components;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            A base fee which represents a fixed fee component
          </li>
          <li>
            A component based on the area of the property
          </li>
          <li>
            A component based on the value of the property
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       These fee components can be used in any combination. If there is no fee applicable for a
      specific service, all 3 fee components can be zeroed.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Registry includes a default set of services that are described in the following sections.
      Note that these can be reconfigured to match those services required by the land
      administration agency.
