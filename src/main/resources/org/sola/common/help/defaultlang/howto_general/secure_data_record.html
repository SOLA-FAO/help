       Registry supports the application of security classifications to commercially sensitive or
      culturally sensitive data records in order to limit the users that can view those records. To
      configure security for a specific record, click <img hspace="4" src=
      "../images/icons/lock.png" style=" margin-left: 0.0px;">Security in the applicable details
      screen. This will open the Security dialog.

    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       You can select a Classification level and/or a Redact level. If the Classification level is
      set, only users with that classification level (or a higher level) will be able to view the
      record.&nbsp; If the user has a lesser classification level, the record will not appear in
      any search results or lists preventing them from accessing the record.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Redact level can be used to obscure specific fields on the record (i.e. redaction). The
      record will still appear in search results or other lists, but when the user views the
      record, the redacted fields will either appear blank or contain a generic message to inform
      the user they are not viewing the actual data value. Redaction can be useful where it is
      necessary for users to be aware that a record exists, but should not be aware of sensitive
      details within the record.

    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">

            The Redact field will only display if the record type has been configured to support
            redaction. Currently the only record type that supports redaction is Party.

          <li>
            You can set both the classification level and redact level for the same record. Be
            aware that if you set the classification level to a higher security level than the
            redact level, then the redact level will have no effect as the classification will
            prevent the record from being displayed to users with a lower security level.

            Users are assigned security classifications through assignment of Registry security
            roles. Contact the System Administrator if you believe your security classifications
            are not configured correctly.

            The fields subject to redaction must be configured during customization of Registry. It
            is not possible for users to specify the fields that are to be redacted, only the
            redaction level. &nbsp;
