       Record Ownership
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Ownership details are linked to the primary right for the property and each property should
      only have one active primary right. The primary rights supported by Registry are Apartment,
      Ownership, and State Ownership. These rights represent the estate type for the property.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To create a primary right and record ownership details on a new property you can use the New
      Freehold Title or Convert to Digital Title services.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       There may also be situations where the property information migrated into Registry does not
      include ownership details. In this case you can add ownership details to an existing property
      using the Registration on Title or New Apartment Title services.

          </li>
          <li>
            On the Rights / Restrictions tab, the select the type of primary right to create (one
            of Ownership, Apartment Ownership or State Ownership) and click the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/create.png">Create tool to create a pending primary right and open the
            Ownership screen.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            Update the Notation text and add references to documents that confirm the ownership
            details.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ownership rights consist of one or more shares which are expressed as fractions.&nbsp;
            The fractions from all current shares on the property must sum to 1. To enter a new
            share for the property, click<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/add.png">Add in the
            Shares section.
          </li>
          <li>
            A share may be allocated to one or more parties. A party can be an individual or an
            entity. Shares that are allocated to more than one individual or more than one entity
            are considered undivided (a.k.a. joint tenants). This means Registry does not record
            the exact share for each party simply that multiple parties participate in the same
            share.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            To add parties to the share, click<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/add.png">Add.
            This will open the Party Details screen allowing you to enter in details for an
            individual or an entity. Once the necessary party details have been entered, click<img
            hspace="4" src="../images/icons/save.png">Save &amp; Close.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once all parties have been added to the share, click<img hspace="4" src=
