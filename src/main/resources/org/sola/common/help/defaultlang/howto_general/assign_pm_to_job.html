       Assign a Property Manager to a Job
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       A Property Manager is a party assigned to manage and maintain a State Land Property or Job.
      Any issues or actions affecting the property or job should be assessed and actioned by the
      Property Manager. In SOLA State Land Property Managers are usually configured as teams in
      order to create groups of users. This streamlines the assignment of jobs as the users
      available in the Assign to dropdown of the Assignment dialog can be filtered through the
      selection of a Property Manager.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The steps to assign a Property Manager to a Job are the same as assigning a user to a job.
      Refer to the Assign a User to a Job for details.
