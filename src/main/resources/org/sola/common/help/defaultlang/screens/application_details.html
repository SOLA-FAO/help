            can proceed. This fee is based on the service(s) selected for the application and the

            calculated when a new application is lodged.

             Registry prevents assignment of applications that have not had their fees paid. Once
            the client or agent has paid the application fee, you can flag the application for
            further processing by checking the Paid checkbox. At the same time you can optionally
            record the amount paid as well as any receipt numbers. Note that the Paid checkbox will
            only be editable if you have the appropriate user role.&nbsp;
