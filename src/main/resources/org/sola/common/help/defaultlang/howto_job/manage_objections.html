       Where the actions of the state may be perceived to impact on the rights or freedoms of other
      parties then those parties may choose to object to the states actions. The Manage Objections
      task can be used to track and manage objections related to a job.

       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>

      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Lodge a new job. Make sure it includes the Manage Objections task.
          </li>
          <li>
            From the Tasks tab of the Job Details screen, select the Manage Objections task and
            click the <img src="../images/icons/start.png" hspace="4">Start tool. The Objection
            List&nbsp;screen will display.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            Click <img src="../images/icons/add.png" hspace="4"> Add to open the Objection
            Details&nbsp;screen. Enter details to describe the objection including a description,
            the authority that will consider the objection and the objection status. You should
            also enter the parties raising the objection on the Parties tab, list the properties
            affected by the objection on the Property tab and link scanned copies of documents
            related to the objection on the Documents tab.
          </li>
          <li>
            An objection may be subject to legal proceedings so it is important that a timeline of
            key events is accurately captured. You can use the Timeline tab to <img src=
            "../images/icons/add.png" hspace="4"> Add comments describing events as they occur
            thereby sequencing them into the event timeline.
          </li>
          <li>
            Objections can include confidential information. It this is the case, use <img src=
            "../images/icons/lock.png" hspace="4">Security to ensure only authorized personnel can
            view the objection details.
          </li>
          <li>
            When all information for the objection has been entered, click <img src=
            "../images/icons/confirm-close.png" hspace="4">Close to return to the Objection List
            screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click <img src="../images/icons/save.png" hspace="4"> Save on the Objection List screen
            to save your new objection details along with any subsequent edits that you have made.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can continue to <img src="../images/icons/add.png" hspace="4"> Add other objections
            by repeating steps 3 to 7 above. You can also&nbsp;<img src=

            objections as required.
          </li>
          <li>

            On the Tasks tab of the Job Details screen, select the Manage Objections task and click
            the <img src="../images/icons/confirm.png" hspace="4">Complete tool. This will run the
            SOLA State Land business rules to validate the job data. If there is a critical
            failure, you must remedy the failure as it will not be possible to approve the job
            otherwise.

          <li>
            If all tasks for the job are complete (or cancelled), proceed with approving (and
