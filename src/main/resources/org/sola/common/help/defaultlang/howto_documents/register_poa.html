       Register Power of Attorney
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       This service is used to register a Power of Attorney that authorises a person (attorney) to
      act on behalf of another (grantor) in private affairs, business or some other legal matter.
      Once registered, the Power of Attorney can be associated to any application to support
      property transactions made under the Power of Attorney.

            From the Dashboard select the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/new.png">New
            application tool to open the Application Details screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the General tab, enter the contact details for the person making the request and
            select the agent from the Agent drop down if appropriate.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Services tab, add the Registration of Power of Attorney service to the
            application.
          </li>
          <li>
            This service does not directly reference a property so no property information is
            required on the Property tab. &nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Documents tab, record each of the physical documents provided by the person
            registering the POA. At a minimum the Registration of Power of Attorney service
            requires a Power of Attorney document. 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                Ensure you select the appropriate document type and record the document date (i.e.
                the date recorded on the face of the physical document) or today’ s date if the
                physical document is not dated.
              </li>
              <li>
                Enter a reference number for the document and a description. The reference number
                should be taken from the physical document. If the physical document does not have
                any reference number, then enter the application number, period and document
                sequence number (e.g. 120001.03).
              </li>
              <li>
                The Source Agency is the name of the organization that created the physical
                document. E.g. For the POA, this may be the name of the grantor. This field is
                optional and can be left blank.
