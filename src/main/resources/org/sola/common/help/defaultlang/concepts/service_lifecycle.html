       Task Lifecycle

    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Like jobs, tasks can also exist in different states which they transition to via task
      actions.&nbsp; The actions you can apply to a task are
    </p>

    <table style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" cellspacing="2" border="0" cellpadding="2">

             This action is triggered when you save a new task for the first time. The Lodge action
            causes the task to be assigned the Lodged status.

          <p>
             To start processing the task, use the Start tool on the Job Details Tasks tab toolbar.
            The Start action transitions the task into the Pending status.
          </p>
          <p>
             The Start tool is available when the job is assigned and one of the tasks in the task
            list is selected.

             If a task is no longer required or is inappropriate for the job, the task can be
            cancelled using the Cancel tool on the Job Details Task tab toolbar. The Cancel action
            transitions the task to the Cancelled status. Note that all tasks must be in the
            Cancelled or Completed status before the job can be approved.
          </p>

             The Cancel tool is available when the job is assigned and one of the tasks in the task

             To complete processing of the task, use the Complete tool on the Job Details Task tab
            toolbar. The Complete action executes business rules for the task and transitions it to
            the Complete status if the rule checks are successful. Note that all tasks must be in
            the Cancelled or Completed status before the job can be approved.

             During quality review or approval, if the user determines a task requires further
            attention, they can reset the status of the task using the Revert tool on the Job
            Details Task tab toolbar. The Revert action transitions the task back to the Pending
            status for further processing.
          </p>

             The Revert tool is available when the Job is assigned and the selected task has the
