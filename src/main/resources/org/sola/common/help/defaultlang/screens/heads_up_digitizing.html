       Heads up Digitizing
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To assist capturing new state land parcels you can load an image of a survey plan onto the
      Parcel Map Editor and digitize the shape using the Add New State Land Parcel tool <img
      hspace="4" height="15" src="../images/icons/state-land-add.png" style=
      " margin-left: 40.0px;">.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To add a plan image to the map you must first have an image file available on your local
      hard drive. The file formats supported by the Map Viewer are TIFF, PNG and JPEG. If you have
      an image in a different format (e.g. PDF), then you will need to convert the file to one of
      the accepted image formats before it can be displayed in the Map Viewer.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Add Image tool <img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/image-add.png">&nbsp;works by
      matching two points you select on the map with two points you select from the image. For the
      best match accuracy, the first node you select should be at the bottom left of the plan image
      and the second point at the top right (or top left and bottom right). The image is then
      scaled and displayed in the Map Viewer accordingly.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Note that the current Add image tool does not rotate the image. If the plan does not have a
      standard North orientation, then do not attempt to digitize from the plan as the result will
      be inaccurate. If you need to remove the plan image from the map use the Remove Image
      tool<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/image-remove.png">.
