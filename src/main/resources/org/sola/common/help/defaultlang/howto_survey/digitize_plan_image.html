       Add a Plan Image for Digitizing
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       When performing a Change to Cadastre or Redefine Cadastre service, you can choose to add an
      image of the plan to the Map Viewer to assist with digitizing the survey point data directly
      from the plan.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To add a plan image to the map you must first have an image file available on your local
      hard drive. The file formats supported by the Map Viewer are TIFF, PNG and JPEG. Before
      adding the image, you should also select the target parcels as they may be difficult to
      select after the image is added.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Add Image tool<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/image-add.png" style=
      " margin-left: 0.0px;">works by matching two points you select on the map with two points you
      select from the image. Before adding the image, you should compare the plan to the Map Viewer
      and identify two candidate parcel nodes that exist on both the plan and the Map Viewer.&nbsp;
      For the best match accuracy, the first node you select should be at the bottom left of the
      plan image and the second point at the top right (or top left and bottom right). Note that
      the current Add image tool does not rotate the image. If the plan does not have the standard
      North orientation, then do not attempt to digitize from the plan as the result will be
      inaccurate.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Once you have the image file ready, identified the two matching points and selected your
      target parcels, click the Add image tool<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/image-add.png"
      style=" margin-left: 0.0px;">. You will be prompted to select the first of two points on the
      Map Viewer. Zoom in if necessary to ensure your selection is accurate. You will then be
      prompted to select a second point. Again, zoom in if necessary to ensure your selection is
      accurate.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Add Image tool will then prompt you to select your image file from your local hard
      drive. Upon making your selection, the image file will be displayed in the Add Image Preview
      dialog. You can enlarge this dialog as necessary to improve your selection accuracy. Click
      the image at the location matching the first point you selected from the map. A green cross
      will appear on the image. Click the image at the location matching the second point from the
      map and a second green cross will appear.

       <b>Add Image Preview dialog with two selections</b>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To proceed, click the OK button on the Add Image Preview dialog. The image will be scaled as
      required and displayed in the Map Viewer.&nbsp; The image will display on top of the standard
      Map Viewer navigation layers, but will appear below the editing layers added for Change to
      Cadastre and Redefine Cadastre.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       If you make a mistake, you can remove the image from the Map Viewer using the Remove Image
      tool<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/image-remove.png" style=" margin-left: 0.0px;">and
      re-add the image. You can also change your selections in the Add Image Preview dialog by
      re-selecting the location of the first point after you have added the second point. Be aware
      that re-selecting the first point will require you to re-select your second point as well.
