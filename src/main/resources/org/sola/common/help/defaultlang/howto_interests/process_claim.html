       Claims over land, particularly state land, can be oral or traditional claims by indigenous
      or ethnic minority groups, as well as claims for unregistered rights such as rights of way,
      usufruct rights, mining rights, and boundary and ownership disputes.SOLA State Land records
      details about claims as a Claim interest allowing for multiple, overlapping claims to be
      individually recorded over the state land property they affect.
