       SOLA State Land provides case management functionality that ensures only the user assigned
      to a job can <img src="../images/icons/start.png" hspace="4">Start and <img src=
      "../images/icons/confirm.png" hspace="4">Complete job tasks. By default jobs are
      automatically assigned to the user that lodges the job. To assign a job to a different user,
      check the checkbox beside the job you want to reassign in the My jobs list of the Dashboard.

            The Assign action is also available from the Job Details screen
          </li>
          <li>
            If the job you need to reassign is not displayed in your My jobs list on the Dashboard,
            you can use the Job Search screen to locate the job and reassign it to a different user
            using the steps described above.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            Where there are a large number of users, the Property Manager dropdown can be used to
            filter the list of users in the Assign to dialog to those users that are part of the
            selected Property Manager team.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can only assign jobs to another user if you have the Assign to Others security
            role. If you do not have this role, you will not be able to change the Assign to
            dropdown (it will be preset with your name). The Property Manager dropdown will list
            all teams that you are part of and you can change this if appropriate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Both the Dashboard and Job Search can be used to reassign multiple jobs at the same
            time. Simply check the checkbox beside multiple jobs before clicking <img src=
            "../images/icons/assign.png" hspace="4"> Assign. All checked jobs will be assigned to
            the user selected in the Assignment dialog.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unless you have the Assign to Others security role, you will only be able to reassign
            jobs that you are currently assigned to
