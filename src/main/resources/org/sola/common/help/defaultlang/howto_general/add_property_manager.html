       Add or Edit Property Managers
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Property Managers are listed in the Property Manager drop down on the Assignment dialog and
      they are displayed on various other screens as read only details.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Party Search screen allows you to quickly locate and add or modify Property Manager
      details. To locate all Property Managers in SOLA State Land, search using the Property
      Manager role. You can then edit the details for a specific Property Manager by selecting the
      appropriate search result and clicking <img src="../images/icons/pencil.png" style=
      " margin-left: 0.0px;" hspace="4">Edit. This will open the Party Details screen allowing you
      to edit and <img src="../images/icons/save.png" style=" margin-left: 0.0px;" hspace="4">Save
      the new party information.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To add a new Property Manager, click <img src="../images/icons/add.png" style=
      " margin-left: 0.0px;" hspace="4">Add on the Property Search screen and enter the necessary
      party details. You must also ensure you add the Property Manager role to the party to
      indicate the party is a Property Manager. It is also recommended that you add the Team role
      to the party as most Property Managers are used to define teams of users within SOLA State
      Land.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       If you need to remove a Property Manager so they are no longer available for selection when
      assigning a Job or Property, simply remove the Property Manager role from the party record.
