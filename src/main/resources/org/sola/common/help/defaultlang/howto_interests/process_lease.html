       Record, Change and Cancel Leases
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The state can enter into lease agreements as a lessee or grant leases over state land as the
      lessor. In the case where the state acts as the lessor, the Lease Interest screen provides a
      number of pre-configured reports to assist the state land agency to grant leases. The reports
      can produce a draft offer and lease document as well as the finalized offer and lease
      document once all information is confirmed. The rejection letter report can be used if the
      state chooses to reject a lease request.
    </p>
    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Record Lease
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Record Lease task allows you to record new lease agreements over a state land property.
      You can record a Lease interest over a property and identify the lessee. The Record Interest
      task can also be used to create a lease interest on a property.
