       Cancel Titles and Create New Titles
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The New Freehold Title service can be used to create new titles over new parcels created as
      a result of plan subdivision (e.g. Change to Cadastre) or similar actions. The Cancel Title
      service can be used to cancel a title by changing the status of a property to Historic. The
      Cancel Title and New Freehold Title services usually go together as it is often necessary to
      cancel a title so that one or more new titles can be created in its place. Note that the
      Cancel Title and New Freehold Title services can be used independently although Cancel Title
      should be used with caution if there is no new title to replace the one being cancelled.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The trigger for creating new titles will usually be the approval of an application with a
      Change to Cadastre service. As part of the plan approval, the Survey staff member will create
      a new application with a Cancel Title service and the appropriate number of New Freehold
      Title services (one for each new parcel that requires a title). Survey will also link the
      plan image to the new application so that Land Registration can determine the parcels to
      reference when creating the new titles.

    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Verify Application
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Before processing the application to create new titles, you should check that it contains
      the appropriate number of services by referring to the details of the
      plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Steps</b>
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Verify that the application has a Cadastral Survey document with the image of the
            approved plan associated to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Review the plan image and confirm that the application has a Cancel Title service if
            the plan extinguishes any parcels due to subdivision or amalgamation. Note that only
            one Cancel Title service is required even if there are multiple titles to cancel.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            Check that all of the titles for the underlying parcels on the plan (i.e. the parcels
            being subdivided or amalgamated) have been added on the Property tab of the
            application. The Cancel Title service will only allow cancellation of those properties
            listed in the Property tab.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check that the application has a New Freehold Title service for each new parcel that
            requires a title. For example, if there are 5 new parcels requiring titles, then ensure
            there are 5 New Freehold Title services on the application. A New Freehold Title
            service can only be used to create one title.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there are any issues with the application, add or remove services as necessary
            and/or consult with the Survey staff member that created the application.
          </li>

       Cancel Titles
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Use the Cancel Title service to cancel the titles for the extinguished parcels. Note that if
      there are no titles to cancel, this step can be skipped.
