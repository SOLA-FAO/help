       Manage Notifications
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The state is obligated to ensure all parties that may be affected by its actions in relation
      to state land are adequately notified of the state’s intentions. Where the state has
      sufficient information to determine those parties that are likely to be affected by its
      actions (such as land owners and right holders), it can choose to notify those parties
      directly by letter or phone. The Manager Notifications task can be used to identify the
      parties the state may choose to inform about a state land project and can help to track which
      notifications are sent to those parties.
