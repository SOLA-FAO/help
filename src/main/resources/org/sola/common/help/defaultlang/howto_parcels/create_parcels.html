       Create or Change Parcels
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       When new land is being acquired by the state land agency or there are changes required to
      existing state land parcels, you can use the Create or Change Parcels task to make those
      changes. &nbsp;This includes changes to any text details for the parcel (e.g. area,
      description, state land status, land use or locality) as well as changing the spatial
      definition for the parcel.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Create or Change Parcels task provides tools that allow you to modify the network of
      state land parcels. The following describes the basic process flow for capturing parcel
      information. Variations to this basic flow are possible.&nbsp;

        <ol>
          <li>
            Lodge a new job. Make sure it includes the Create or Change Parcels task.
          </li>
          <li>
            From the Tasks tab of the Job Details screen, select the Create or Change task and
            click the <img src="../images/icons/start.png" hspace="4">Start tool. This will open
            the Parcel Map Editor screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the Map Viewer is not already zoomed to the location of the job, use the map search
            or the map navigation tools to locate the area for the job.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the parcel(s) you need to edit are already displayed in the map (either as state
            land parcels or underlying parcels), use the Select State Land Feature tool <img src=
            "../images/icons/state-land-select.png" hspace="4">&nbsp;to add those parcels to the
            job by clicking them. The Parcel Details screen will display allowing you to edit any
            of the parcel information as required.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you need to change the shape of an existing state land parcel, make sure you have
            selected the parcel first using the Select State Land Feature tool <img src=
            "../images/icons/state-land-select.png" hspace="4">, then use the Edit State Land
            Parcel tool <img src="../images/icons/state-land-edit.png" hspace="4">to change the
            parcel shape. 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                To move a node on a state land parcel hover the mouse above the node you wish to
                move. The node should change colour and display a green square. Press and hold the
                left mouse button to pick up the node and drag it to its new location. Release the
                left mouse button to drop the node.

            boundary nodes of the parcel. Double click the last boundary point to complete the
            capture. This will display the Parcel Details screen with default values for the plan
            number and area. Correct these values if necessary and enter the parcel number along

            Be sure to set the relevant state land status for each parcel as follows 
            <ol start="1" type="a">
              <li>
                The parcel should have a status of Proposed until it has been formally purchased
                (or leased) by the state.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>
                Once purchased (or leased), the parcel should be assigned a status of Current.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the parcel is no longer actively used by the state which can occur in the case
                of land banking, the status should be set to Dormant.
              </li>
              <li>
                When the parcel is identified as surplus to requirements and it is a candidate for
                disposal, the status should be set to Surplus
              </li>
              <li>
                Once the parcel has been formally sold (or the lease has expired), the status of
                the parcel should be set to Disposed.
