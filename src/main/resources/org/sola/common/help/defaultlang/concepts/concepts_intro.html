       SOLA State Land Concepts
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       SOLA State Land is designed to assist governments and state agencies to manage property
      owned or vested in the state from acquisition through to disposal. While using this guide you
      will encounter a number of terms representing SOLA State Land concepts. A description for
      these concepts and how they should be interpreted in the context of SOLA State Land is
      provided here.

          <p>
             SOLA State Land employs business rules to automatically validate the data entered by a
            user to ensure consistency of the data as well as warning the user of potential
            irregularities. Business rules are usually executed just prior to changes in state of a
            Job or a Task (e.g. Job Approval) but can also be manually triggered using the
            Validation tool in the Job Details screen.
          </p>
          <p>
             All business rules have a severity rating and the failure of any critical business
            rule will cause the current action to be aborted. In this situation, the user will be
            required to remedy the issue reported by the failed critical rule(s) before processing
            can continue.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
             SOLA State Land includes a default set of business rules that can be reconfigured to
            match those required by the State Land Agency.

             Documents are records created in SOLA State Land that capture summary details about
            legal, official or other documentation. Typically documentation is provided in paper
            form and must be scanned into digital format so that it can be attached to the document
            records created for a Job.
          </p>
          <p>
             SOLA State Land includes a number of document types to help categorize the
            documentation received. These types can be reconfigured to match the types used by the
            State Land Agency.

             Interests are the specific rights, restrictions and responsibilities (a.k.a. RRR) that
            can be recorded on a State Land Property e.g. ownership, lease, claims, easements,
            conditions, liabilities, etc.

        <td>
          <p>
             The State Land Agency can use Jobs to monitor and manage significant activities that
            must be undertaken in relation to State Land Property e.g. acquisition, maintenance or
            disposal.
          </p>
          <p>
             Jobs have a lifecycle and transition into different states as the State Land Agency
            processes the Job. The primary role of a Job is to implement case management
            functionality in SOLA State Land.&nbsp;

            be described using a metes and bounds description.
