       Registry&nbsp;Concepts
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       While using this guide you will encounter a number of terms representing Registry concepts.
      A description for these concepts and how they should be interpreted in the context of
      Registry is provided here.

             An individual or organization that is requesting information or changes to the land
            registry and/or cadastre information recorded in Registry. This could be a lawyer or
            surveyor under instruction from the property owner, the property owner themselves or a
            third party with a vested interest in a particular property. The request made by the
            agent is managed in Registry as an application. &nbsp;

             Applications capture details and manage requests received by the land administration
            agency to change, update or report on land registry and/or cadastre information.
            Applications have a lifecycle and transition into different states as the land
            administration agency processes the request that instigated the application. The
            primary role of an application is to implement case management functionality in
            Registry. &nbsp;

          <p>
             Registry employs business rules to automatically validate the data entered by a user
            to ensure consistency of the data as well as warning the user of potential
            irregularities. Business rules are usually executed just prior to changes in state of
            an application or a service (e.g. application approval) but can also be manually
            triggered using the Validation tool in the Application Details screen.
          </p>
          <p>
             All business rules have a severity rating and the failure of any critical business
            rule will cause the current action to be aborted. In this situation, the user will be
            required to remedy the issue reported by the failed critical rule(s) before processing
            can continue.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
             Registry includes a default set of business rules that can be reconfigured to match
            those required by the land administration agency.&nbsp;

          <p>
             Represents the information recorded in Registry about all of the parcels under the
            jurisdiction of the land administration agency. A key component of the cadastre is the
            spatial definition of parcels as this illustrates the shape, geographic location as
            well as the spatial relationship (i.e. topology) between parcels.
          </p>
          <p>
             Registry validates all changes that occur to the spatial definition of parcels in
            order to prevent the formation of gaps and overlaps between adjacent parcels that would
            otherwise compromise the integrity of the cadastre.

        <td>
          <p>
             Documents are records created in Registry that capture summary details about legal,
            official or other documentation supplied by the agent to support their request for
            changes to the land registry and/or cadastre information. Typically documentation is
            provided in paper form and must be scanned into digital format so that it can be
            attached to the document records created for the application.
          </p>
          <p>
             Registry includes a number of document types to help categorize the documentation
            received and also requires certain document types to accompany services.
          </p>
          <p>
             Registry includes a default set of document types that can be reconfigured to match
            those required by the land administration agency.

        <td>
          <p style=" margin-left: 0.0px;">
             Represents an area of land to which ownership rights apply. Parcels captured in
            Registry should have a spatial definition that illustrates the shape and geographic
            location of the parcel although this is not a mandatory requirement. Parcels without a
            spatial definition may be referred to as “aspatial” or “textual” parcels.

             Used to control the type of change an application can make to the land registry and/or
            cadastre information recorded in Registry. Services broadly identify the actions the
            land administration agency will undertake for the application. Every application lodged
            in Registry must include at least one service.
