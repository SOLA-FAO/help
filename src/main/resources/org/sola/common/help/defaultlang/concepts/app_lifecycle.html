       The State Land Agency can use Jobs to monitor and manage significant activities that must be
      undertaken in relation to State Land Property e.g. acquisition, maintenance or disposal.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Jobs can exist in different states as they progress through SOLA State Land. To transition a
      job into a different state you need to trigger an action, although not every action causes
      the job to change state. The actions you can apply to an application are

             Following assessment of the job and completion of all tasks (completion or
            cancellation), the job may be approved using the Approve tool in the Job Details
            toolbar. Usually approval will be completed by a different team member who will first
            review the job details ensuring they are accurate and complete before the details are
            accepted. The Approve action executes the approve business rules for the job and
            transitions it into the Approved status if the rule checks are successful.
