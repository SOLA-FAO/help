       Dispose Property
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       When the state has no further use for a property, it has the option to dispose of the
      property by selling or gifting it to another party. The Dispose Property task can be used to
      record the disposal of a property in SOLA State Land. Note that SOLA State Land does not
      delete the property record and it is still possible to search and view the property
      information after the disposal is completed, however SOLA State Land will prevent any further
      edits to the property details.&nbsp;

            Lodge a new job. Make sure it includes the Dispose Property task. You also need to <img
            src="../images/icons/add.png" hspace="4"> Add the state land property you want to
            dispose on the Properties tab so SOLA State Land knows which property is to be
            disposed.
          </li>
          <li>
            From the Tasks tab of the Job Details screen, select the Dispose Property task and
            click the <img src="../images/icons/start.png" hspace="4">Start tool. The Property
            Details screen will display.&nbsp; 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                If you get a message indicating the property to display cannot be determined for
                the task, ensure you have added the property you want to dispose on the Properties
                tab of Job Details. <img src="../images/icons/save.png" hspace="4"> Save your
                changes and try to <img src="../images/icons/start.png" hspace="4"> Start the task
                again.
              </li>
              <li>
                If there is more than one property listed in the Properties tab of Job Details, the
                Select Property dialog will display allowing you to choose which property to
                display. Click your choice to open the Property Details screen.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Click the <img src="../images/icons/stop.png" hspace="4">Dispose tool in the main
            toolbar. This will flag the property for disposal and change the tool to <img src=
            "../images/icons/undo.png" hspace="4">Undo disposal. 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                If the Dispose tool is not enabled, it means the property you are trying to dispose
                was created on a job that has yet to be approved. Identify the job that created the
                property and approve it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Prior to approval of your job, you can reverse the disposal by clicking <img src=
                "../images/icons/undo.png" hspace="4"> Undo disposal.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="../images/icons/save.png" hspace="4">Save and close the Property Details
            screen to return to the Job Details screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Tasks tab of the Job Details screen, select the Dispose Property task and click
            the <img src="../images/icons/confirm.png" hspace="4">Complete tool. This will run the
            SOLA State Land business rules to validate the job data. If there is a critical
            failure, you must remedy the failure as it will not be possible to approve the job
            otherwise.
          </li>
          <li>
            If all tasks for the job are complete (or cancelled), proceed with approving (and
            archiving) the job. This will update the status of the State Land Property to Disposed
            and prevent it from being used in any other job.

            Once a property is disposed and the associated job is approved, it is not possible to
            reverse the disposal. If the same property is subsequently reacquired by the state, it
            will be necessary to create a new State Land Property record in SOLA State Land.
