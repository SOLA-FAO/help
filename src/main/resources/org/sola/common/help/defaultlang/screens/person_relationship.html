       Person Relationship
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Person Relationship screen can be used to record a relationship between two parties such
      as a husband and wife, parent and child, grandparent and grandchild or other similar
      relationships. The purpose is to safeguard the interests of one of the parties (the
      notifiable party) and inform them of any changes to the property rights held exclusively by
      the other party (the target party).&nbsp; The goal of this feature is to prevent the
      notifiable party from being unduly disadvantaged if the target party sells, trades or
      transfers the property rights they hold. To access the Person Relationship screen you need to
      lodge an application containing one of the following services; Record Person Relationship or
      Cancel Person Relationship. Once the application is lodged and assigned, you then need to<img

      from the Application Details Services tab.

       Record the details of the party to be notified on the Notifiable Party tab. Notifications
      are sent via email, so an email address is mandatory. To create a Person Relationship, you
      need a copy of Vital Record such as a Birth Certificate, Marriage Certificate, Death
      Certificate, etc. to verify the relationship between the two parties. Use the <img hspace="4"
      src="../images/icons/document-link.png">Link Document tool to link a scanned copy of Vital
      Record proving the validity of the relationship.&nbsp;

       On the Target tab, select the appropriate Relationship type and enter a reference. You then
      need to identify the target party by entering their name in the Party name field and clicking
