       Logging
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       From time to time you may encounter unexpected issues while trying to run SOLA State Land.
      Usually the error message will recommend a course of action, but occasionally you may
      encounter a technical issue that requires further investigation by the IT Support Team or
      another SOLA technical person. To assist that investigation you may be asked to provide a
      copy of the log files supporting SOLA State Land. The logs capture exception information and
      status messages that can help a technical person to determine the cause of a particular
      issue.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       This section describes the two types of logs available with SOLA State Land; the
      SOLAApplication Logs and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) logging. It also describes how to
      access information from those logs
    </p>
    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       SOLA&nbsp;State Land Application Logs
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Each SOLA Web Start application (i.e. SOLA State Land Desktop and SOLA Admin) creates an
      application log file on your local computer to capture exceptions and various status
      messages. You can find those log files at the following directory location <b>&lt;User Home
      Directory&gt;/sola/logs</b>.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The name of the log file will be DesktopApplication_&lt;date&gt;.log (for SOLA State Land
      Desktop) or AdminApplication_&lt;date&gt;.log (for SOLA Admin). Simply open the appropriate
      log and copy the text from the log file into your email reply or issue ticket.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Note that your &lt;User Home Directory&gt; will depend on the operating system of your
      computer. For example, under Windows Vista and Windows 7 this will be C:\Users\&lt;Your
      Windows User Name&gt;.
    </p>
    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Java Runtime Environment (JRE)&nbsp;Logging
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       SOLA is a Java application and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) also provides a detailed
      logging capability. The advantage of using JRE Logging is that every exception and/or status
      message is reported whereas the SOLA Application Logs only capture SOLA specific exceptions
      and messages and may not necessarily capture the true cause of an issue.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       JRE Logging is <b>not</b> turned on by default. You need to use the Java Control Panel to
      turn on the Java Console which can then be used to turn on JRE Logging as required. To turn
      on the Java Console and JRE Logging.

      the logging level in the Java Console.
