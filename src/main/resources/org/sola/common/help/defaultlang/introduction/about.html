    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       This guide is intended for general users of the SOLA Registry solution (Registry) and it
      describes the screens and functions of Registry. As a general user, you should familiarize
      yourself with the content of this guide, particularly the <a href=
      "../concepts/concepts_intro.html">Registry Concepts</a>&nbsp;and <a href=
      "../screens/dashboard.html">Registry Desktop Screens</a> sections
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The How To sections list step by step instructions describing how to complete common Land
      Administration tasks using Registry. You should refer to the relevant How To section when
      attempting a new task until you become familiar with the necessary steps. You should also
      refer to this guide if you need to refresh your memory of the steps required for tasks you
      haven’t completed in a while.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       This guide is subject to change as new versions of Registry are released with new or
      enhanced features. If you identify content that is missing from this guide, out of date, or
      requires further explanation or elaboration, you should contact the SOLA FAO Team with a
      brief outline of the issue and we will update the guide content in&nbsp;subsequent releases.
