       Securing Land Tenure through Automation
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Land administration and cadastral systems play a crucial global role in safeguarding the
      security of access to land and natural resources. Automation of land administration through
      the use of information technology has become increasingly common and similarly the
      appreciation that automated systems can contribute positively to land tenure security through
      providing systems that:
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            involve elements of best land administration practice;
          </li>
          <li>
            are sensitive to the customs and laws of the country;
          </li>
          <li>
            do not create an unacceptable dependency on expertise or items of equipment that are
            difficult to obtain, maintain and afford; and
          </li>
          <li>
            are sustainable.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       When done correctly, automation improves efficiency and transparency through the
      standardisation of land administration practices along with better access to land information
      records. This in turn has a positive impact on the overall governance of land tenure.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Another benefit of automation is to reduce many of the drivers behind inappropriate land
      office staff behaviour making it easier to detect and more traceable if it does occur. Well
      published standards of service delivery and the ability to monitor each application processed
      against those standards provide a level of transparency impossible to achieve with paper
      based systems. In addition, using automated business rules to automatically validate the
      information entered for an application in preference to manual checking not only allows
      application processing to be streamlined, but also reduces the need for land office staff to
      apply discretion. This further reduces the possibility of coercion or the temptation for
      staff to behave inappropriately. Changes to processes and business rules also require a
      systematic controlled approach, reducing the ability for ad-hoc changes and variations.
    </p>
    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Automation in Developing Countries
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       While automation is becoming more prevalent in developing countries, they have largely
      lagged behind developed countries in the introduction of computerised systems. Often where
      automation has been introduced, this has been achieved by taking a highly sophisticated
      system from a developed country and implementing it in a way that could be likened to a “copy
      and paste” action of a word processing software package. Not only is this type of
      implementation insensitive to the law, customs and practices of the host country, these
      systems often require a high level of expertise to operate and maintain in countries where
      skills may be in short supply. In most cases there are also on-going commercial software
      licence and software support fees that need to be paid each year. After the project for the
      initial implementation is completed even more demands are made on already stretched local
      budgets to cover further licence fees to be paid as the system is rolled-out to other
      district offices.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       One option for addressing these issues is the use of open source software. Open source means
      that, unlike proprietary software, developers have access to the software’s “engine”, which
      can be freely modified and extended. Open source solutions are more flexible and adaptable to
      local conditions and languages than proprietary software. By using and improving open source
      software, land administration agencies can build local knowledge and contribute to the public
      development of open source projects (via web communities, etc) that can in turn benefit other
      land administration agencies world-wide.
    </p>
    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Solutions for Open Land Administration (SOLA)
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       In December 2012, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
      successfully concluded the Solutions for Open Land Administration (SOLA) project. The 2.5
      year project was funded by the Government of Finland and dedicated to implementing an open
      source computerised cadastre and registration system that is both affordable and sustainable
      in the context of developing countries. The open source software produced by the SOLA project
      (also called SOLA) was based on international good practice for service delivery, responsible
      governance of tenure (including transparency of process and transparency of tenure details),
      robust data management and the need for enterprise scale software. The underlying data
      structures used by the SOLA software are also based on the Land Administration Domain Model
      (LADM), now published as ISO 19152 by the International Organization for Standardization
      (ISO).
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       As the laws and practices governing land administration are often unique to a country, SOLA
      was designed to be customisable so that it could appropriately reflect the laws and practices
      of the host country. To test the effectiveness of the software and the approach used for
      customisation, the SOLA project included three pilot implementations in Ghana, Nepal and
      Samoa. Each pilot implementation was undertaken by a team of local software developers who
      were first trained by an FAO SOLA mentor so they could undertake the required customizations,
      support the pilot implementations and maintain the software. Each pilot presented its own
      challenges with many lessons learned by the FAO SOLA Team along the way.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Along with the Samoa Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and the Nepal Ministry of
      Land Reform and Management there are now seven operational implementations of SOLA including
      the Lesotho Land Administration Authority, the Tonga Ministry of Lands, Environment, Climate
      Change and Natural Resources and implementations supporting systematic land titling and
      registration work in Ondo, Kaduna Kano and Kogi States (Nigeria). Various extensions to the
      original SOLA software have been developed through these implementations including support
      for systematic registration, lease management, inclusion of orthophoto layers and an
      interface to finance systems.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Interest in SOLA continues to grow and FAO has continued to support SOLA through the
      assistance available to countries wanting to implement the&nbsp;<a href=
      "http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/" target="_blank">Voluntary Guidelines
      on Responsible Governance of Tenure</a> (VGGT). In this new context, SOLA is seen as an
      excellent example of an enabling technology that improves transparency and service delivery
      in land administration agencies – key elements to improve land tenure governance. The
      European Union has offered its support through the VGGT by funding the Arabic, French and
      Russian versions of SOLA as well as the preliminary work for the Mass Property Valuation
      extension. Additional language versions are also in progress with Spanish, Portuguese and
      Chinese versions due for release in early 2015.

       Evolution of SOLA
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Development of SOLA has continued at a fast pace to the point where the original SOLA
      software has now evolved into a suite of solutions under the SOLA umbrella.

    <h2>   
       Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment   
    </h2>   
    <p>   
       The Independent State of Samoa gained independence in 1962 having been administered by   
      Germany (1900 – 1914) and then New Zealand (as a United Nations Trust Territory from 1945 –   
      1961). It has a population of 186,340 (October 2011 Census) and a land area of 2,831 square   
      kilometres. Agriculture (primarily coconut based products), fishing, tourism and remittances   
      from Samoans working overseas are the main contributors to the Samoan economy. All government   
      cadastral and registration services are provided by the Ministry of Natural Resources and   
      Environment (MNRE) whose offices are all located in the capital Apia (on the island of   
      Upolu). Apia is also the main commercial centre of Samoa and most of the private sector   
      surveyors licensed to undertake cadastral surveys are based there too.   
    </p>   
    <p>   
       80 percent of the land in Samoa is held under customary ownership and this land is protected   
      under the constitution. Samoan society is still strongly focussed on village life and the   
      associated traditions. Customary land is not owned individually but communally with most land   
      being associated with a chiefly (matai) title. The matai has authority (pule) to decide on   
      the permitted uses for that land by other members of his family group. One forum for the   
      resolution of disputes concerning customary land is the Land and Titles Court (but it should   
      be noted that “Titles” in this case mean chiefly titles).   
    </p>   
    <p>   
       The remaining non-customary land consists of 12 percent of freehold land and 8 percent of   
      public land. Cadastral and registration records of parcels of land within these non-customary   
      categories of land are recorded within the formal cadastral and registration systems. A small   
      number of blocks of customary land subject to a lease are also with the formal systems. The   
      computerised cadastral mapping system, known as Samoa View, has 21,000 parcel records (July   
      2009). The computerised Land Registration System holds 12,000 current titles.   
    </p>   
    <h3>   
       Cadastral Arrangements   
    </h3>   
    <p>   
       Cadastral surveys are undertaken under the Survey Ordinance 1961. New legislation for   
      cadastral surveys under the Survey Act 2010 have been passed by Parliament and implemented by   
      MNRE. Any change in boundaries for freehold or Government land (or for the registration of a   
      lease over customary land) requires a cadastral survey signed by a registered surveyor. Most   
      of these surveys are performed by private sector surveyors. A survey plan is lodged with the   
      MNRE where it is checked by the Quality Assurance Section of the Technical Division. Once the   
      survey is considered to meet all requirements (including the standards described in the   
      Survey Regulations) the survey is approved by the Chief Executive Officer. The survey is then   
      able to support registration actions including the issuance of new titles. Once the survey is   
      approved the new boundaries are recorded in the (computerised) Samoa View mapping system.   
    </p>   
    <h3>   
       Registration Arrangements   
    </h3>   
    <p>   
       Samoa moved to a system of title registration with the implementation of the Land Title   
      Registration Act 2008 on 2 March 2009. This change was accompanied by the introduction of   
      standardised forms, the implementation of a computerised system and the legal recognition of   
      the computer based records, in particular the “computer folio”.   
    </p>   
    <p>   
       Although it is possible for individuals to complete their own documents for registration, it   
      is common practice for people needing to register a land transaction to engage the services   
      of private lawyer to prepare and lodge the necessary documents with the MNRE. Details are   
      entered into the computerised system at the time of lodgment. Staff from the Registration   
      Section scan all lodged documents and associate them with the lodgment record, which has also   
      been referenced to the appropriate computer folio (title) at the time of lodgment data entry.   
      Land registration staff then check that the lodged documents are able to registered. Once   
      these checks are done the Registrar registers the transaction and the computer folio is   
      automatically updated to reflect the new registration.   
    </p>   
    <p>   
       The public and MNRE staff can also request various computer folio search products and these   
      are produced by the computerised system. Likewise the computerised system creates new   
      computer folio certificates when a new survey plan is registered (as well as canceling the   
      superseded computer folios).

       Solutions for Open Land Administration (SOLA)
    </h1>
    <p>
       In December 2012, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
      successfully concluded the Solutions for Open Land Administration (SOLA) project. The 2.5
      year project was funded by the Government of Finland and dedicated to implementing an open
      source computerised cadastre and registration system that is both affordable and sustainable
      in the context of developing countries. The open source software produced by the SOLA project
      (also called SOLA) was based on international good practice for service delivery, responsible
      governance of tenure (including transparency of process and transparency of tenure details),
      robust data management and the need for enterprise scale software. The underlying data
      structures used by the SOLA software are also based on the Land Administration Domain Model
      (LADM), now published as ISO 19152 by the International Organization for Standardization
      (ISO).
    </p>
    <p>
       As the laws and practices governing land administration are often unique to a given country,
      SOLA was designed to be customisable so that it could appropriately reflect the laws and
      practices of the host country. To test the effectiveness of the software and the approach
      used for customisation, the SOLA project included three pilot implementations in Ghana, Nepal
      and Samoa. Each pilot implementation was undertaken by a team of local software developers
      who were first trained by an FAO SOLA mentor so they could undertake the required
      customizations, support the pilot implementations and maintain the software. Each pilot
      presented its own challenges with many lessons learned by the FAO SOLA Team along the
      way.&nbsp;

    <p>
       The Independent State of Samoa gained independence in 1962 having been administered by
      Germany (1900 – 1914) and then New Zealand (as a United Nations Trust Territory from 1945 –
      1961). It has a population of 186,340 (October 2011 Census) and a land area of 2,831 square
      kilometres. Agriculture (primarily coconut based products), fishing, tourism and remittances
      from Samoans working overseas are the main contributors to the Samoan economy. All government
      cadastral and registration services are provided by the Ministry of Natural Resources and
      Environment (MNRE) whose offices are all located in the capital Apia (on the island of
      Upolu). Apia is also the main commercial centre of Samoa and most of the private sector
      surveyors licensed to undertake cadastral surveys are based there too.
    </p>
    <p>
       80 percent of the land in Samoa is held under customary ownership and this land is protected
      under the constitution. Samoan society is still strongly focussed on village life and the
      associated traditions. Customary land is not owned individually but communally with most land
      being associated with a chiefly (matai) title. The matai has authority (pule) to decide on
      the permitted uses for that land by other members of his family group. One forum for the
      resolution of disputes concerning customary land is the Land and Titles Court (but it should
      be noted that “Titles” in this case mean chiefly titles).
    </p>
    <p>
       The remaining non-customary land consists of 12 percent of freehold land and 8 percent of
      public land. Cadastral and registration records of parcels of land within these non-customary
      categories of land are recorded within the formal cadastral and registration systems. A small
      number of blocks of customary land subject to a lease are also with the formal systems. The
      computerised cadastral mapping system, known as Samoa View, has 21,000 parcel records (July
      2009). The computerised Land Registration System holds 12,000 current titles.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Cadastral Arrangements
    </h3>
    <p>
       Cadastral surveys are undertaken under the Survey Ordinance 1961. New legislation for
      cadastral surveys under the Survey Act 2010 have been passed by Parliament and implemented by
      MNRE. Any change in boundaries for freehold or Government land (or for the registration of a
      lease over customary land) requires a cadastral survey signed by a registered surveyor. Most
      of these surveys are performed by private sector surveyors. A survey plan is lodged with the
      MNRE where it is checked by the Quality Assurance Section of the Technical Division. Once the
      survey is considered to meet all requirements (including the standards described in the
      Survey Regulations) the survey is approved by the Chief Executive Officer. The survey is then
      able to support registration actions including the issuance of new titles. Once the survey is
      approved the new boundaries are recorded in the (computerised) Samoa View mapping system.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Registration Arrangements
    </h3>
    <p>
       Samoa moved to a system of title registration with the implementation of the Land Title
      Registration Act 2008 on 2 March 2009. This change was accompanied by the introduction of
      standardised forms, the implementation of a computerised system and the legal recognition of
      the computer based records, in particular the “computer folio”.
    </p>
    <p>
       Although it is possible for individuals to complete their own documents for registration, it
      is common practice for people needing to register a land transaction to engage the services
      of private lawyer to prepare and lodge the necessary documents with the MNRE. Details are
      entered into the computerised system at the time of lodgment. Staff from the Registration
      Section scan all lodged documents and associate them with the lodgment record, which has also
      been referenced to the appropriate computer folio (title) at the time of lodgment data entry.
      Land registration staff then check that the lodged documents are able to registered. Once
      these checks are done the Registrar registers the transaction and the computer folio is
      automatically updated to reflect the new registration.
    </p>
    <p>
       The public and MNRE staff can also request various computer folio search products and these
      are produced by the computerised system. Likewise the computerised system creates new
      computer folio certificates when a new survey plan is registered (as well as canceling the
      superseded computer folios).
    </p>
    <h2>
       SOLA&nbsp;Samoa
    </h2>
    <p>
       The objectives of SOLA Samoa were to
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Migrate Samoa View (DCDB) to an open source environment that supports cadastral mapping
        functions, processing of lodged cadastral survey plans, cadastral map and survey plan
        searches.
      </li>
      <li>
        Migrate the Land Registration System (LRS) to an open source environment that supports
        dealing registration functionality, computer folio (title) certificates and existing LRS
        search products.
