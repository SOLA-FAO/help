       Hold a Job
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       If you have the appropriate security role you can place a job on hold by selecting <img src=
      "../images/icons/requisition.png" style=" margin-left: 40.0px;" hspace="4">&nbsp;Hold in the
      Job action dropdown in the Job Details screen. Hold is enabled depending on the state of the
      job. While a job is on hold, you cannot make any further edits to it or update its tasks. Be
      aware that SOLA State Land treats jobs that are on hold as inactive. This means the job will
      not display in your My Jobs list on the Dashboard while it remains on hold.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       If you need to reinstate the job to complete further work, search for the job using Job
      Search. Once you have located the job, open it and select <img src=
      "../images/icons/resubmit.png" style=" margin-left: 0.0px;" hspace="4">Resume in the Job
      action dropdown. This will revert the job to the Lodged status allowing you to continue work
      on it.
