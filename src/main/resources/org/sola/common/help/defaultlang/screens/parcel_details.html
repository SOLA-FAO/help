    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Parcel Details screen allows you to view or edit parcel information. It can be accessed
      from the Parcels tab on the Property Details screen by selecting a parcel to view and
      clicking <img src="../images/icons/view.png" hspace="4">View or <img src=
      "../images/icons/pencil.png" hspace="4">Edit. It is also available from the Parcel Map Editor
      when creating or updating parcel records.

       <b>Parcel Details</b>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       You can enter the parcel number (a.k.a. lot number), plan number, area, state land status
      and land use for the parcel as well as a description and locality.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       If the parcel has no spatial definition, you should enter a metes and bounds description for
      the parcel that describes the general size and shape along with its approximate location. If
      the parcel does have a spatial definition, you can enter any relevant details in the
      description such as the buildings and structures that are located on the parcel.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The locality of the parcel can be a house number, street address or a general geographic
      location. SOLA State Land allows a parcel to have multiple localities specified as some areas
      of land have multiple local and formal location descriptions.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Where the parcel is part of a state land property, you can also indicate its state land
      status. The state land statuses available include

       The state land agency must manually update the state land status of the parcel as and when
      appropriate. SOLA State Land does not modify the state land status except to set the status
      of all parcels to disposed when the state land property containing the parcels is disposed
      using the Dispose Property task.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Parcel Details screen does not support editing the spatial definition of the parcel. To
      modify the spatial definition, you must use the tools available in the Parcel Map Editor when
      processing a Create or Change Parcels task.&nbsp;

          </li>
          <li>
            Once purchased (or leased), the parcel should be assigned a status of Current.

            If the parcel is no longer actively used by the state, which can occur in the case of

            When the parcel is identified as surplus to requirements and it is a candidate for

            Once the parcel has been formally sold (or the lease has expired), the status of the
