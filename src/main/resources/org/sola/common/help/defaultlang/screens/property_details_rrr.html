       The Rights and Restrictions (RRR) tab shows summary information for all current and pending
      (i.e. unregistered) rights and restrictions on the property. You can access further
      information about a specific right or restriction by selecting the RRR from the list and
      clicking the<img hspace="4" style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" src="../images/icons/view.png">View
      toolbar button. The RRR details screen displayed will be dependent on the RRR you selected,
      however it should contain detailed information about the RRR as well as any supporting
      documentation that was linked to the RRR when it was first recorded.&nbsp;
