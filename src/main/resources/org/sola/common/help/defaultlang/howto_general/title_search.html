       Perform a Title Search
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Title Search service is used to indicate that information on a particular property has
      been requested by an agent or a member of the public. It requires printing and optionally
      certifying (i.e. stamping) the Property Report for the named property.

          <li>
            On the General tab, enter the contact details for the person making the request and
            select the agent from the Agent drop down if appropriate.

          <li>
            On the Property tab, enter the title references for the property or properties that
            have been requested. You can quickly check if Registry records information about a
            property using the <img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/document-task.png">Verify tool.
            If the Titles Exist flag remains unchecked, it means Registry does not contain a record
            for the property and will not be possible to produce a Property Report.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            No supporting documents are required for this service, so there is no need to enter any
