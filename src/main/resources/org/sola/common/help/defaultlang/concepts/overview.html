       <i>“Land should be regarded as ‘State Land’ if it is owned or occupied by the state, even if
      its management or control has been delegated by the public sector to an agency, a private
      body, or a public private partnership … State land … is defined as being land owned, managed,
      occupied or controlled by any level of government and not just by central government</i>.”
      (Grover/FAO 2010).
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       State Land is more than bare land. It includes the land, buildings and other improvements
      permanently attached to it that must be administered in socially, environmentally and
      economically sustainable ways.&nbsp; State Land Administration can encompass land policies,
      land rights, property, economics, land use control, regulation, monitoring, implementation,
      land allocation, settlement and development. Many of the actions involved in the
      administration of State Land involve judgement, analysis of sometimes conflicting or
      incomplete information, decisions about competing uses or interests. Many of these tasks
      cannot be fully automated. What can be automated is the collection, assembly and presentation
      of data, standard processes, check lists, results of analysis and investigation and of
      administrative decisions and the exchange of data with other agencies, such as the cadastre,
      registration and valuation agencies.

    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Unlike privately owned land, State land can be subject to quite intensive public interest
      and political influence. Importantly State land administration can become an instrument for
      the implementation of national and regional government policies, and in turn information on
      State land holdings can inform and guide the development of policies on the use of State
      lands.<br style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">

             The landholdings of a state can be vast and it is common for state land to be
            identified that was not previously inventoried. The state may also be advised of land
            vested to their control by previous land holders or of land that was simply abandoned.
            In these cases, the state must investigate and capture relevant details about the land
            in their inventory system.

             The state may acquire land from the private sector using various means such as open
            market purchase, compulsory sale, voluntary exchange, lease, etc. All acquisitions must
            be supported by fair, equitable and transparent processes with all rightholders
            affected by the acquisitions notified and provided with information about their rights
            including rights to object and/or appeal decisions.

             The state has a responsibility to maintain state land, buildings and structures to an
            adequate standard which can involve contracting maintenance and repair work to third
            party organizations. General maintenance of the state land inventory may also be
            required to ensure any claims or interests in the land are accurately recorded.

             The state is not restricted to simply owning land. The state can enter into lease and
            license agreements as either the lessor or the lessee. The state is responsible for
            managing and maintaining these agreements and ensuring all conditions are met including
            payment of any rentals or fees.

             State land that is no longer required by the state can be disposed via sale, grant or
            exchange. As with acquisition, the processes for disposal must be fair, equitable and
            transparent to ensure the best outcome for the state and avoid claims of corruption.
