       Manage Negotiations
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The state may need to enter negotiations with land owners and rightholders to secure new
      land acquisitions or dispose of surplus state land. The Manage Negotiations task can be used
      to track and manage these negotiations.

                If you have created any new state land properties (using Record New Property) or
                linked properties to the job on the Properties tab of Job Details, these will
                display on the Job tab of the Property Search screen. Highlight the property you
                want to add a negotiation for and click <img src="../images/icons/confirm.png"

                Use the State Land tab if you want to search for an existing State Land property to

            amount, the date of first notification and set the status to indicate the stage of the
            negotiation. You can optionally add scanned copies of any documents related to the
            negotiation such as sales contracts and sales conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the negotiation is successfully completed, enter the final amount agreed between the

            Negotiations between parties can be drawn out and convoluted. SOLA State Land attempts
            to capture key information (i.e. initial offer, final amount and negotiation status) to
            streamline management of the negotiation process. Where the negotiation results in
            multiple counter offers, the material generated by this process can be captured as
            document attachments.
          </li>
          <li>
            The negotiate status can be used to track the stage the negotiation is at and you
            should update the status for each negotiation regularly.
